# Ownership - [Chapter 4][rustbook-ch4]

## Exercises

### Ownership and Borrowing
Create three functions - each of which accepts a string and appends “one”, “two”, and “three” to the string respectively. After running each of the functions, print the string - you should end up with “onetwothree”.
  - Using ownership only (no borrowing)
  - Using mutable borrows
  - Using immutable borrows only

### Slices
Using slices from the complete string created in the previous question, print each of the words on a new line.

### Bonus
Run each of the three functions in separate threads
